    <p> Hello everyone! Here are a few interesting facts about me:</p>
    <p>I am currently a computer science major but am considering switching to CIT because I would like to go into the cyber security feild. 
        This will be my fifth semester at BYU Idaho.</p>
    <p> I am from Oregon. I got married this summer. I love the outdoors. Some of my favorite hobbies are flyfishing, rock clibing, and shooting.
        I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all my life. I served a mission in Puerto Rico and speak Spanish.
